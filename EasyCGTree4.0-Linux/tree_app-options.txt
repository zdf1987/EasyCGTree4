IQ-TREE Command-line=iqtree2.exe --alrt 1000 -B 1000


NOTE: 
1. Just change the part after "=".
2. The input alignment (-s XXXX) will be specified automatically by EasyCGTree.


IQ-TREE Command-line examples:

1. Infer maximum-likelihood tree from a sequence alignment with the best-fit model automatically selected by ModelFinder:
     iqtree2.exe

2. Perform ModelFinder without subsequent tree inference:
     iqtree2.exe -m MF

3. Combine ModelFinder, tree search, ultrafast bootstrap and SH-aLRT test (default):
     iqtree2.exe --alrt 1000 -B 1000

4. Find best partition scheme followed by tree inference and bootstrap:
     iqtree2.exe -p example.nex -m MFP+MERGE -B 1000
